### Solution for Rich ISsue #2406

## Steps to get started 

# command 1 inastall cmd 2 and rich in system 

python -m pip install rich

python -m pip install -U pip setuptools

pip install cmd2

# So the solution is we have to create a python file which will initiciate cmd2 and then we have to integrate it  with rich 
# and then create a shourtcut script in the "Scripts folder" with is a feature of cmd2 and then directly run rich from there 
# in that way will get best of both worlds and our issue will be solved 
# or we have to re code the whole rich to make it iteractive like cmd2 
# so this is the easierr way to do this. 

# I couln,t implemnet the solution because of lack of time it was taking some time to understand how to implemnt the shorctuts in cmd2
# but I created the program to iniciate cmd2 withi python we just need to create a command for rich to work with properly and have t.
